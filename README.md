# Custom PC Build & Windows 7 → Windows 10 Pro Upgrade

This repository documents a custom-built desktop PC assembled using a mix of **new, enthusiast-grade components** and **salvaged hardware**, originally configured with **Windows 7** and later upgraded in-place to **Windows 10 Pro**.

A key goal of this project was maximizing reuse of existing hardware while maintaining long-term system stability and performance.

This was my **first PC build**, and it marked the beginning of my journey into IT and hands-on systems work.

## 💾 Storage & Case Configuration

- **Primary Drive:**  
  Salvaged **Western Digital 250 GB SSD** recovered from an aging laptop  
  - Reused as the primary system disk during initial build  
  - Contained the original Windows 7 installation  
  - Successfully migrated through the Windows 10 Pro upgrade

- **Chassis:**  
  Spare **CyberPowerPC** desktop case  
  - Repurposed to house the custom-built system  
  - Provided adequate airflow and ATX compatibility  
  - Demonstrates reuse of prebuilt system components in a custom build

This approach reduced costs, extended the life of existing hardware, and proved reliable over long-term use.

## 🔌 Power Supply Installation

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):**  
  Desktop power supply installed manually during the build  
  - Installed and wired by hand as part of system assembly  
  - Model and wattage not currently documented  
  - Has provided stable and reliable power throughout long-term operation

The PSU installation was a key hands-on step in completing the system and ensuring overall stability despite the mixed-origin components.

## 🌬️ Cooling & Fan Installation

- **Case Fans:**  
  Installed and mounted manually during system assembly  
  - Connected to motherboard headers for controlled airflow  
  - Configured to support overall system cooling and stability  

Installing the fans was part of learning proper airflow, cable routing, and physical system layout during my first build.

## 🧠 Memory Configuration

- **Installed RAM:** 32.0 GB  
- **Usable RAM:** 31.9 GB  
- **Virtual Memory:** 36.7 GB  
- **Page File:** Enabled (`C:\pagefile.sys`)

## 🧩 Project Background

This system was assembled by:
1. Reusing a functional laptop SSD as the system disk
2. Installing new desktop-class components around that storage
3. Housing the system in a spare CyberPowerPC case
4. Installing and wiring the power supply manually
5. Installing and configuring case fans for airflow
6. Running Windows 7 initially for compatibility
7. Performing an in-place upgrade to Windows 10 Pro without data loss

Despite the unconventional mix of components, the system has remained stable and fully functional.

## 🔄 Operating System Upgrade Notes

- Upgrade performed using Microsoft’s official Windows 10 upgrade tools
- Existing Windows 7 installation on salvaged SSD preserved
- No clean install required
- UEFI and Secure Boot remained enabled post-upgrade
- Drivers updated manually where required

---

## ⚠️ Lessons Learned

- Salvaged SSDs can remain viable when health is monitored
- Desktop systems tolerate mixed-origin components well
- Prebuilt PC cases can be successfully repurposed
- PSU and fan installation are critical to long-term stability
- Planning UEFI early simplifies future OS upgrades
- Documentation matters more the longer a system lives

---

## 🔮 Future Plans

- [ ] Replace salvaged SSD with a larger-capacity drive (clone existing system)
- [ ] Document storage migration process
- [ ] Add GPU history and upgrades
- [ ] Performance benchmarking before/after storage upgrade
- [ ] Assess Windows 11 viability (CPU generation limitations noted)
- [ ] Identify and document PSU model (optional)
